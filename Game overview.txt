ðŸŽ® Game Overview â€“ "Whispers in the Dark"
Final Objective:
Unlock and rotate three statues outside the mansion to face the house. Once all are aligned, a secret door opens to the ritual room. Entering the room plays a final cutscene, ending the game.

ðŸ—¿ Statue Rotation Requirements (Main Puzzles)
Each of the 3 statues requires solving a unique puzzle to unlock rotation:

Drakemore Journal Puzzle

Find the journal locked in a trunk in the dining room (requires solving a padlock combination).

Return the journal to the study bookshelf (upstairs).

This reveals a hidden room with a lever. Pulling it unlocks the ability to rotate one statue.

Valve Cap Puzzle

Find the valve cap in the bathroom (ground floor, next to stairs).

Return it to the basement and turn it.

This unlocks a hidden room inside the main bedroom containing a lever that unlocks a second statue.

Marble Minigame Puzzle

Also found in the bathroom, the marble must be brought to the minigame setup in the main bedroom.

Completing the game releases a key.

Use the key to open a locked trunk in the same room containing a Drakemore family portrait.

Return the portrait to its corresponding statue to unlock rotation.
